# phylobabble: Statement of Work

This statement of work is meant to accompany my previously submitted application, which outlines the rationale behind the points I describe here.
Contact: Erick Matsen ([matsen@fhcrc.org](mailto:matsen@fhcrc.org))

* Move phylobabble to a [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) image
* Migrate this image to a less expensive [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) server
* Configure daily backups to Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3)
* Keep the software running the site up to date
* Serve as head moderator
* Promote discussion on current topics, including posting papers
* Advertise the site

I estimate these tasks will take 15 hours this year, which at $50/hr would mean $750.
Digital Ocean is $20 per month, and thus 12 months will cost $240.
This comes to a grand total of $990.
